Dependency Injection
--------------------

Finatra internally uses the Google `Guice <https://github.com/google/guice>`__ dependency injection library extensively which is also available for service writers if they choose to use dependency injection.

.. attention::
  You are **not required** to use `Guice <https://github.com/google/guice>`__ dependency injection when using Finatra. 
  Creating servers, wiring in controllers and applying filters can all be done without using any dependency injection. 
  However, you will not be able to take full-advantage of Finatra's `testing <../testing/index.html>`__ features.

An example of Finatra's dependency-injection integration is adding controllers to Finatra's `HttpRouter <https://github.com/twitter/finatra/blob/develop/http/src/main/scala/com/twitter/finatra/http/routing/HttpRouter.scala>`__ *by type*:

.. code:: scala

    class Server extends HttpServer {
      override def configureHttp(router: HttpRouter) {
        router.add[MyController]
      }
    }


As mentioned, it is also possible to do this without using `Guice <https://github.com/google/guice>`__, simply instantiate your controller and add the instance to the router:

.. code:: scala

    class NonDIServer extends HttpServer {
      val myController = new MyController(...)

      override def configureHttp(router: HttpRouter) {
        router.add(myController)
      }
    }
