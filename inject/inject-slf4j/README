Overview
========

The Finatra framework uses the [SLF4J API](https://www.slf4j.org/) for logging. By coupling the
framework to only SLF4J application developers can choose the logging implementation.


`c.t.inject.Logging` Trait
--------------------------

The inject-slf4j library provides a thin trait: `c.t.inject.Logging` over the util-slf4j-api [`c.t.util.logging.Logging`](https://github.com/twitter/util/blob/develop/util-slf4j-api/src/main/scala/com/twitter/util/logging/Logging.scala)
trait, which adds a few more utilities and makes the logging trait safe for inclusion mixed into a
case class which is serialized to JSON.


SLF4J Mapped Diagnostic Context Support
---------------------------------------

The library also provides a [Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC)](https://www.slf4j.org/manual.html#mdc)
integration with SLF4J and [Finagle](https://github.com/twitter/finagle) via util LocalContexts.

See https://twitter.github.io/finatra/user-guide/logging/index.html for more information.

Note
----

Tests for the inject-slf4j library are located in the inject-core library due to the need for the
tests to use the testing utilities of inject-core and the fact that inject-core depends on
inject-slf4j which would create a circular dependency.
